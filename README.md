Design Goals
------------

- Implementing web software should be easy.
- Allow extensibility with custom code
- Interop with existing community code
- Should be usable by people who don't have domain knowledge in Web dev 

What is an Appcubator App?
--------------------------

Short version

It starts out as a JSON of data which the user can modify using the browser interface.
Then the nodes of the JSON tree go through macro-expansion to generate code.
Then the code is written to disk, and shipped off to a server to be redeployed.

Long version

At the lowest level, an Appcubator app is an Express.js web server application,
which responds to HTTP requests to serve pages and respond to form submissions.
It also connects to a MongoDB instance to persist and retrieve data.

On a higher level, an Appcubator app can be thought of in terms of
Data Models, Pages (or Routes), and Templates.

On a higher level, each component of the app can be generated from user-inputted data,
using a "Generator".
A Generator is a javascript function which takes in data which the user provides, and turns it into an Appcubator component.

On a higher level, the components of an Appcubator app form a tree of data which can be represented as a JSON in the browser. This JSON tree is called the app-state.

User Interface
--------------

Main editor is the Template editor

* CSS Editor
* Model Editor
* Routes Editor
* Generic Generator Editor
* Plugin Editor

(List any other major views here)

Describe how the app state turns into a Nested Backbone Model and Collection structure

* Implementation details
* Rendering and drag and drop in the iframe
* Any Backbone hacks
* Overall structure of the backbone code



Deployment
----------

For local testing, the app state will be sent to a server running the code generator,
which will expand the macros, and return a zip file of the source code
which you can download.

You can extract the code, run npm install to install dependences,
and run the server with `node app.js`.




Old text that i dont know what to do with
------------

Your app is a JSON tree of macros which expand to code.
The generated apps are powered by Node.js and MongoDB.

The JSON tree, called the app state, has the following structure:

- models - database schema, functions for backend logic, and API endpoints
- templates - html templates for pages
- routes - url + logic that runs when you serve pages. also server side db or misc apis
- css - styling code for your pages. you can use prewritten themes to get started quickly

When you interact with the visual interface, youâ€™re implicitly adding or configuring the code generators in these sections.
When you "publish", the app state is sent to the server where your app is hosted. There the code generators in each section are fully expanded to code and stored on disk.
